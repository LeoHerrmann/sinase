New paremter: size: increased probability of finding food, increased energy consumption
Bugfix: creatures_manager.create_new: Calculation of average of maximum and minimum of a parameter was faulty


15.10.2019
Creature Class
move(), eat(), and check_energy were relocated from creatures_manager to individual creatures
creatures_manager.create_new() puts creatures to a random location in the environment instead of onto the border
